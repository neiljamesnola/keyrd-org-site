  <p>
    A <strong>nudge</strong> is a subtle prompt designed to steer you toward healthier choices—without pressure, judgment, or the burden of food logging. KeyRD nudges are personalized and adaptive, using real-world data to support your health goals over time.
  </p>

  <h2>How Nudges Work in KeyRD</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clinically Informed:</strong> Nudges are grounded in behavior change theory, Medical Nutrition Therapy guidelines, and your chronic condition profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Context-Aware:</strong> We use passively collected signals (e.g., time, device, wake/sleep cycles, quiet hours, and location patterns) to deliver nudges when they’re most likely to help.</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern Learning:</strong> Over time, KeyRD learns your preferences, response patterns, and optimal timing—just like a smart coach.</li>
    <li><strong>Tone-Matched:</strong> You choose your preferred nudge style (gentle, motivating, directive, or humorous). We’ll speak your language.</li>
    <li><strong>Location-Based:</strong> Nudges may change depending on whether you’re near a grocery store, restaurant, or home kitchen—helping bridge intention with opportunity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>
    At 11:30 AM, just before your usual lunch, you might receive: <em>"You're near your usual grocery stop. Want a fast lunch idea that fits your goal?"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    On a stressful day, a gentle nudge might say: <em>"Rough morning? A good snack now might prevent late-day cravings."</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Behavior change is hardest when it depends on willpower alone. Nudges reduce friction. When timed right, they transform intention into action—without you needing to track every bite.
