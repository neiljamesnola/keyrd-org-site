  <h1>What is a Nudge?</h1>

  <p>
    At KeyRD, a <strong>nudge</strong> is a micro-intervention designed to guide healthier choices in real time—without requiring you to log food or remember your goals. Nudges are subtle, actionable prompts triggered by your behavior, environment, or clinical profile.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    Behind the scenes, KeyRD uses:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location awareness</strong> (e.g., if you're near a grocery store or fast food)</li>
    <li><strong>Clinical logic</strong> (e.g., tailored for hypertension, diabetes, or lipid profiles)</li>
    <li><strong>Behavioral models</strong> (like COM-B, TTM, and reinforcement learning)</li>
    <li><strong>Temporal patterns</strong> (e.g., time of day, meal timing, stress exposure)</li>
    <li><strong>Passive data</strong> (like steps, sleep, heart rate, or phone usage)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Our goal is not to shame or restrict. It’s to learn what works for you. Over time, KeyRD adapts based on your responses—nudging you when it’s most effective, backing off when it’s not. We aim to balance behavioral support with autonomy and trust.
  </p>

  <h2>Scientific Foundation</h2>
  <p>
    Nudges are grounded in clinical guidelines and evidence-based nutrition. Every prompt is vetted for relevance and backed by rigorous research—both human trials and real-world observational datasets.
