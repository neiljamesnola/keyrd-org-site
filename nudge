    <h1>What is a Nudge?</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    A <strong>nudge</strong> is a subtle, timely suggestion designed to improve your behavior without restricting your freedom of choice. At KeyRD, nudges are not guesswork—they are science-backed, context-aware micro-interventions.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Nudges Matter</h2>
  <p>
    Behavior change is hard. Traditional advice is often too generic, too late, or simply too much. Nudges help by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Showing up just-in-time—when you’re most likely to act</li>
    <li>Learning your patterns, habits, and routines over time</li>
    <li>Adjusting based on your location, goals, and preferences</li>
    <li>Being backed by <em>clinical nutrition guidance</em> and behavioral science</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How They Work</h2>
  <p>
    Each nudge is generated by our adaptive engine that combines:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location data</strong> (with permission) to anticipate food decisions</li>
    <li><strong>Wearable and phone sensors</strong> (e.g., steps, sleep, heart rate)</li>
    <li><strong>Clinical rules</strong> based on Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)</li>
    <li><strong>Machine learning</strong> that models your response patterns</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In short, KeyRD nudges feel personal because they are—each one learns from the last.
  </p>

  <h2>Memory, Adaptation, and Agency</h2>
  <p>
    Our nudge system remembers what works, adapts when things don’t, and gives you control. You’re always in charge—we just help illuminate the next best step.
