    <p>
      A <strong>nudge</strong> is a small, well-timed prompt that helps guide your behavior—without restricting your freedom of choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <strong>KeyRD</strong>, our nudges are designed to be:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>🧠 <strong>Personalized:</strong> Tailored to your unique biometric patterns, lifestyle, and clinical needs.</li>
      <li>⏱️ <strong>Just-in-Time:</strong> Sent at the moments they matter most—before a meal, during stress, or post-activity.</li>
      <li>📚 <strong>Evidence-Based:</strong> Grounded in proven principles from behavioral science, nutrition, and clinical research.</li>
      <li>👐 <strong>Non-Coercive:</strong> Designed to assist, never insist. Nudges inform your decision—they don’t dictate it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Unlike rigid diet plans or endless food tracking, nudges meet you where you are—helping shift behaviors gently but meaningfully over time.
